# The Content Alchemist - AI-Augmented Marketing Campaign Generator
# Portfolio project showcasing event-driven, AI-centric automation architecture

## Project Context
- This is a portfolio project for securing a JS Automation Developer role
- Target: AI-First company in European tech market
- Focus: Demonstrate orchestration of multiple cloud services and AI models

## Core Architecture
- **Human Interface:** Google Sheets + Apps Script
- **Orchestration:** N8N (self-hosted via Cloudflare Tunnel)  
- **Cache/Rate Limiting:** Valkey/Redis (Heroku)
- **Pre-processing:** Deno Deploy (TypeScript)
- **AI Transcription:** AssemblyAI
- **AI Generation:** Google Gemini
- **Output:** Google Docs, Jira tasks

## Technical Constraints & Preferences
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Apps Script is NOT Node.js - use Apps Script specific APIs
- N8N workflows should be saved as JSON in repository
- All services use free tiers - be mindful of API limits
- Use clasp CLI for Apps Script development
- Prefer stability over complexity - avoid web scraping

## Development Standards
- **Error Handling:** Always implement try/catch blocks
- **Logging:** Use console.log for debugging in all environments
- **API Keys:** Use PropertiesService in Apps Script, N8N credentials for workflows
- **Caching:** Check Redis before expensive operations (transcription, AI calls)
- **Documentation:** Update relevant .md files when making architectural changes

## AI Workflow Philosophy
1. **Strategic AI (Current chat):** Architecture & planning
2. **Co-pilot AI (Cursor):** Real-time coding & debugging  
3. **Specialist AI (N8N nodes):** Embedded workflow tasks

## Common Patterns to Follow
- **N8N Nodes:** Use native nodes when available (AssemblyAI, Redis, HTTP Request)
- **Apps Script:** Use doGet() for web apps, onOpen() for menu triggers
- **Deno Deploy:** Keep API lightweight, focus on text sanitization
- **Error Recovery:** Build resilient workflows that can retry failed steps

## Current Development Phase
Check DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md for current phase and completed tasks.
Update checkboxes as features are implemented.

## Key Business Rules
- One YouTube URL input generates complete multi-channel campaign
- Human review required before content goes live (via Jira)
- Cache results to prevent duplicate processing costs
- All content delivered as organized Google Drive folders
